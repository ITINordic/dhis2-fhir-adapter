[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates (support for http://jsonpatch.com/ and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386).

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`

|===

[[overview-authentication]]
== Authentication

To use the API authentication is required. Currently only basic authentication is supported. The support will be
extended to OAuth2 in the future. The authentication is verified by DHIS 2 and authorities are granted by DHIS 2 as well
(mapped by the configuration of the adapter).

[[api]]
= API

[[api-enumerations]]
== Enumeration Values

The API re-uses several enumerations. These are described by this section. Enumerations that are used by one one API
resource are documented with the corresponding API resource.

[[api-enumerations-data-type]]
=== Data Type
Data type enumerations are used for defining data the are passed to a script and data that is returned by a script.
Some of the data types can also be used for script arguments. In this case there is a string represenation for that
data type.

|===
| Value | Description

| `BOOLEAN`
| A boolean value. The strings `true` and `false` can be used.

| `INTEGER`
| An integer value without fraction digits. E.g. 10678

| `STRING`
| A string value.

| `DOUBLE`
| A double precision floating point value. E.g. -18.83

| `DATE_TIME`

|===

[[api-enumerations-enrollment-status]]
=== Enrollment Status
- ACTIVE
- CANCELLED
- COMPLETED

[[api-enumerations-event-status]]
=== Event Status
- ACTIVE
- COMPLETED
- OVERDUE
- SCHEDULE
- SKIPPED
- VISITED

[[api-enumerations-event-period-day-type]]
=== Event Period Day Type
The event period day type specifies when a FHIR resource can be used as input for a specific
rule. For this the effective date that is extracted from the FHIR resource is compared relative
to an event specific date. To which event specific date the comparison is performed is defined
by this constant. If this constant is not specified in a rule, then no restriction for the
effective date of the FHIR resource exists.

|===
| Value | Description

| `EVENT_DATE`
| Relative to the event date itself.

| `DUE_DATE`
| Relative to the due date of the event.

| `ORIG_DUE_DATE`
| Relative to the originally calculated due date (not modified by any script).

| `EVENT_UPDATED_DATE`
| Relative to the last update date of the event.

| `VALUE_UPDATED_DATE`
| Relative to the maximum last updated date of any data value of the event.
|===

[[api-resources]]
== Resources

Resources can be divided into three groups:

- Code mapping management.
- Data mapping management.
- Adapter administration.

The response body resource examples in this document use by default content type
application/hal+json.

If you create a new resource, links to other resources can simply be specified
by the URL of the resource (see examples in all resource specific sections). If you
want to update an existing resource, links to other resources must be updated by a
special operation.

If you would like to update the transformation export script of a program stage rule,
the following example will change the link:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -XPUT -u admin:district -d "http://localhost:8081/api/executableScripts/ddc7c612-aabb-4ec4-bd63-6d5220cf666f" -H "Content-Type:text/uri-list" http://localhost:8081/api/programStageRules/a6636c83-f236-48cd-bb2b-592147db9a34/transformExpScript
----

With the following command, the link can be deleted:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -XDELETE -u admin:district http://localhost:8081/api/programStageRules/a6636c83-f236-48cd-bb2b-592147db9a34/transformExpScript
----

Sorting and paging can be achieved as seen below.

[[api-resources-code]]
=== Code Mapping Resources

[[api-resources-code-constant]]
==== Constant
The constant resource enables mapping of a constant value to a configurable value. E.g. the constant GENDER_MALE can
be mapped to the DHIS 2 option set value Male. When another value is used by DHIS 2 (e.g. the letter M for Male),
then just the configurable value must be changed. The rules and transformations does not need to be changed.

[[api-resources-code-code-category]]
==== Code Category
The code category resource is used to group codes. E.g. a category can be used for defining vaccine codes
or organization unit codes.

[[api-resources-code-code]]
==== Code
The code resource is used to define system independent codes. E.g. one code can be
created for a specific vaccine. This code can then be used by rules and transformations.
This code can the be mapped to system specific codes (e.g. country dependent
vaccine codes).

[[api-resources-code-code-set]]
==== Code Set
The code category resource is used to group codes for a specific purpose.
E.g. a code set can be defined that contains all vaccines that result in
a measles immunization. This code set can then be used to check if a rule
is applicable to change measles immunization related information of a
patient.

[[api-resources-code-system]]
==== System
The system resource is used to define coding system. E.g. the CVX standard for
vaccine codes is a coding system with a defined system URI. Also the identifier
values for national patient identifiers are defined within a coding system.

[[api-resources-code-system-code]]
==== System Code
The system code resource is used to define system specific codes and map then
to internally used codes that are used by rules and transformations. E.g. a
system specific code may be a national vaccine code that is mapped to an
internal code.

[[api-resources-data]]
=== Data Mapping Resources

[[api-resources-data-script]]
==== Script
The script resource defines a single script with a specific purpose. The script
itself cannot be executed. Only executable scripts can be executed. There may be
more than one executable script for one script (using different script argument
values). The purpose may be a evaluation (e.g. calculating a specific date) or a
transformation (e.g. transformation from FHIR patient to DHIS 2 tracked entity
instance). For one script there may be several script sources (one for each
supported FHIR version). A single script source can also handle multiple FHIR
versions. One script may have several arguments that are passed as a single map
variable to the script. The script may require further variables to execute.

[[api-resources-data-script-argument]]
==== Script Argument
The script argument resource defines a single script argument that belongs to a
script. Event of the script argument is marked as mandatory, providing a value is
not required. The final value must be specified by the executable script argument
in this case. The provided default argument value is only used when the executable
script does not define any override value for that argument

at most.

[[api-resources-data-executable-script]]
==== Executable Script
The executable script resource provides the ability to create an executable
script for a script. There may be more than one executable script for one
script. Each executable script can override the script argument values of the
original scripts. E.g. a script may define an argument for the data element
reference and the unit for the weight of the person. The script may not
define a default value for the data element, but a default value for the unit
(e.g. kilogram). The executable script that processes the weight of a new born
child must then define the value for the data element reference and may
override the unit (e.g. gram because weight precision for a new born child).

type must define a unique identifier in order to be able to map FHIR data
to existing tracked entity instances.

subscriptions for FHIR resources.

[[api-resources-adm-fhir-client-system]]
==== FHIR Client System
The FHIR Client system resource defines a specific coding system that is
used for a FHIR resource. E.g. a FHIR system may use system specific codes for
patients and organizations. The codes that are provided by several FHIR systems
may overlap and are only unique in combination with a FHIR system specific
system URI. For each coding system a code prefix can be defined. E.g. if there
are ten regions in a country and the ten regions use their own FHIR Client than
each region may use its own patient identifiers. These patient identifiers can be
made unique by adding a specific code prefix (e.g. two letter abbreviation of the
regions). This results in a unique national identifier.
